# keyboard-gazer-test-
This is a programme written by c++.
It can record the keys that users had imported.
the record is called ifm.txt
and the programme will run on the background,which means it will hide itself.
Its name is up to you.
it will cost litte resource on windows.
I want to use it in my senior high school club to prevent my classmates from playing video games(although it has some lag).
after the test.
it showed some bugs,and it can't work properly sometimes in the early few seconds(maybe the thread is starting?).
i hope to recerive the comment and advises from you!
